FIXSM712

This is an MS-DOS TSR that fixes up the configuration of the Silicon
Motion SM712 (aka LynxEM+) graphics chip, which is the onboard graphics chip
for ESA-486 motherboards (http://www.esapcsolutions.com/).

The SM712 appears to be a laptop-oriented chip designed for driving an LCD.
In its default configuration, it upscales all video outputs to 800x600
resolution.

When used with a non-800x600 LCD, or any CRT monitor, this only serves to
distort the display. The purpose of this TSR is to re-program the SM712
to output at native resolution following all INT 10h video mode changes,
per the instructions given in the datasheet 
(https://www.usbid.com/assets/datasheets/A8/sm712g.pdf).

Currently only text mode and 640x480x16 graphics mode are tested to work
reliably. The output may be fuzzy and require a good multisync monitor or
LCD as the recommendations in the datasheet involve setting custom dot-
clock frequencies.
